<div>
	In ALM Octane, a pipeline’s unique identification includes this ID.<br>
	When should I change this value?<br>
	<ul>
		<li>When you install the Micro Focus Application Automation Tools plugin instead of the ALM Octane CI plugin. To enable this plugin to work with existing pipelines, change the instance ID to the one used by your pipelines in ALM Octane (Settings > DevOps > CI servers, “Instance ID” column).</li>
		<br>
		<li>If you duplicate your Jenkins installation. Change the instance ID (in any way) to prevent results reported from the new copy of the plugin from being mixed in ALM Octane with results reported from the original one. <br>To separately collect information from the new copy, create new pipelines.</li>
	</ul>
