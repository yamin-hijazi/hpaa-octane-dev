// To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, hostname checks can be done to verify that the hostname in an end-entity certificate matches the targeted hostname.
// TLS does not require such checks, but some protocols over TLS (such as HTTPS) do.
// In earlier versions of the JDK, the certificate chain checks were done at the SSL/TLS layer, and the hostname verification checks were done at the layer over TLS.
// This class allows for the checking to be done during a single call to this class.
